Tips and Tricks:

a. Avoid Bans, make sure to disconnect every few hours from the game

b. Farming server - Grind on empty servers.

c. Don't Share the same PC(AKA android_id) and the IP address for your main account and the bot account!

d. If you get banned, make sure to change the Android ID in the conf file - "C:\ProgramData\BlueStacks_nxt\bluestacks.conf" > android_id.


   

Happy grinding :)
